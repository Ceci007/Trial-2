                The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and 
                Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most influential band of all time. The group were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture 
                and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical 
                music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and 
                hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and 
                were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.

            Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three 
            years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went 
            through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into 
            a professional act and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their 
            first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", the band acquired the 
            nickname "the Fab Four", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of 
            "fifth Beatle".
